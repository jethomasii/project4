## Description
This is my fourth project for CSCI E-15. It's a task manager, you know for Tasks!! 

## Demo
one day they'll be a link here I promise.

## Misc
Includes the jill and jamal users as required. Default tasks are added for jill but not for jamal. You can also sign up for a user, but there's not much of a reason to..
Link to the planning doc: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1A2AWfCPcJD5vdzI2mPTayKBLqmGu1WrenOJLN7ollHQ/edit?usp=sharing
I did not really use the planning doc, fair to say I had no idea how to design this application when the planning doc was due.
The two required tables are Tasks and the pivot table for tasks and users. There's a tags table but I did not have time to implement it, so it's not seeded.

# Outside Materials
I used the laravel docs, php docs and class notes. I did not use any outside packages.
